# Clustering-using-K-Means-and-Bradley-Fayyad-Reina-BFR-algorithm
 Implementation of K-Means and Bradley-Fayyad-Reina (BFR) algorithm from scratch

## **Introduction:**

The goal is to be familiar with clustering algorithms with various distance measurements. 

## **Dataset Description:**

The datasets used are synthetic datasets. 


## **Approach:**

* **Clustering:** Given	a	set	of	points,	with	a	notion	of	distance between	points,	group	the	points into	some	number	of	clusters

* **BFR [Bradley-Fayyad-Reina]:**

◆ Extension	of	k-means	to	large	data
◆ is	a	variant	of	k-means	designed	to handle	very	large (disk-resident)	data	sets
