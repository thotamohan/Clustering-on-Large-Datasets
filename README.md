# Clustering-using-K-Means-and-Bradley-Fayyad-Reina-BFR-algorithm
 Implementation of K-Means and Bradley-Fayyad-Reina (BFR) algorithm from scratch.
 
 * **Clustering:** 
  
  ◆ Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups        are more similar to other data points in the same group than those in other groups. In simple words, the aim is to segregate groups      with similar traits and assign them into clusters.
  
  ◆ Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm and an important task, that help us find more useful insights from data as we are      aware that most of the data in the real-world scenario is unlabelled.
  
  

* **BFR [Bradley-Fayyad-Reina]:**
  
  ◆ BFR is an Extension	of	k-means	to	large	data
  
  ◆ It is	a	variant	of	k-means	designed	to handle	very	large (disk-resident)	data	sets.

## **Introduction:**

The goal is to be familiar with clustering algorithms with various distance measurements. 

## **Dataset Description:**

The datasets used are synthetic datasets. 


## **Approach:**
