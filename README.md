# Clustering-using-K-Means-and-Bradley-Fayyad-Reina-BFR-algorithm
 Implementation of K-Means and Bradley-Fayyad-Reina (BFR) algorithm from scratch without using any library.
 
## * **Clustering:** 
  
  ◆ Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups        are more similar to other data points in the same group than those in other groups. In simple words, the aim is to segregate groups      with similar traits and assign them into clusters.
  
  ◆ Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm and an important task, that help us find more useful insights from data as we are      aware that most of the data in the real-world scenario is unlabelled.
  
  ◆ We are aware about the K-means clustering algorithm for the clustering of the data points but it is not productive for the large       datasets as it takes more memory and time. Thats why Bradley-Fayyad-Reina Algorithm came into existence.
  
  

## * **BFR [Bradley-Fayyad-Reina]:**
  
  ◆ The BFR algorithm, named after its inventors Bradley, Fayyad and Reina, is a variant of k-means algorithm that is designed to           cluster data in a high-dimensional Euclidean space. 
  
  ◆ It is	a	variant	of	k-means	designed	to handle	very	large (disk-resident)	data	sets. However, K-means is used as an main memory         algorithm for generating initial clustering of data points. By making use of Bradley-Fayyad-Reina Algorithm there is a drastic           reduction in memory consumed and time taken for clustering of data points.
